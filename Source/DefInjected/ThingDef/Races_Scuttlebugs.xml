  <Scuttlebug.description>An extra-terrestrial parasite, the Space Worm has been given its nickname by Colonists across the Rimworlds for the way in which it slithers towards its prey. Once a parasite has successfully infected its prey, the prey (host) will undergo a series of symptoms from nausea to unconciousness. After 24 hours, infant Space Worms will hatch from the host, killing them in the process.</Scuttlebug.description>
